Create a web app using Node.js and MongoDB with a homepage featuring a "Sign In" button. Clicking it leads to a sign-in page with options to register using email or Google. User data is stored in MongoDB, and if an email already exists, an error is shown. Successful sign-ins generate JWT tokens for persistent login. Display mock course data from MongoDB on another page. Implement secure JWT authentication, password hashing, and user-friendly error handling. Consider session management, security, and user experience. While complex, this process can be simplified with web frameworks like Express.js and React, enhancing scalability and maintainability.
